body:
  - SCV Rush is an organization of casters, observers, admins, and most importantly, Starcraft fans. We’ve been casting and organizing tournaments since 2011 and we’re still going strong. All of that is thanks to our supporters, you, and our amazing staff.
  - SCV Rush began in 2011 ago with the idea that you don’t have to be a professional gamer to deserve a professional cast. Many players from bronze to GM compete in tournaments and deserve the same excitement that comes with being casted. That’s where SCV Rush started, and we still hold true to that value today. Our goal is to provide the best quality cast, no matter what league you are. SCV Rush is about the community. We tailor to the community of players, and the community of casters.
  - Much like the idea that you don’t have to be a pro to be casted, SCV Rush holds true that you don’t have to be a pro to be a caster. SCV Rush has welcomed all levels of casters to truly provide community engagement. SCV Rush is truly of the community, by the community, and for the community. We thank you for four amazing years, and look forward to sharing the future of Starcraft with you.
